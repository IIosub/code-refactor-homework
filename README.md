### User Story

```
As a software developer, I will have to refactor code which means that my job is to always improve it without changing its functionality. Also, have to make sure my code is clean and meets client requirements.
```

### Acceptance Criteria

Your website must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this by completing the following:

- title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
- making sure that the page has the appropriate HTML tags.
- all images should have alt attributes.
- heading attributes fall in sequential order
- comments must be added for a better understanding of the changes made.
- make sure the code in the CSS does not repeat, if needed make changes in the html to achieve that.

The purpose of this ticket is to refactor code in the existing site to make it more accessible. To do that I started with changing the title, making it more descriptive and SEO-friendly. The divs were replaced with appropriate semantic tags to help SEO and other user devices determine the importance and the context of the page. The right semantic elements are much easier to read and have great accessibility. Alt attributes were added to each picture on the page, which enable screen readers to have information about the image, especially for people with a complete lack of sight, visual impairment or unable to view the image on the page. Also, a great thing about this attribute is that in case the page does not load, the text inside the alt will be displayed. The headings were changed to follow a sequential order. Headings not only highlight the importance of the text but also describe a structure. They have also other benefits since the search engine uses headings when filtering, ordering and displaying results.

The CSS was changed according to the changes made on the HTML pages. There was a lot of repetitive code that was minimised and improved without changing the functionality of the page.
